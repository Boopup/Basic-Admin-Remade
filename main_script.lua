	Instructions:
	Place this Model in
	"ServerScriptService"
	
	
	There is more information regarding
	this admin script in the description
	of the actual model if you are interested.
	
	If you are confused as to how to configure this,
	please scroll to the bottom of this script
	for examples.
	
	As the creator of the game, you are automatically
	owner-admined, so you do not have to add yourself

	* Trello Bans Help
	
	Steps to follow:
	1) Make sure HttpService is enabled, to do so, paste
	"game:GetService('HttpService').HttpEnabled = true" into the command bar.
	2) Make sure Trello Bans is enabled
	3) Make sure the trello board is public
	4) Paste the trello board ID into the Trello Board ID option
	5) On the trello board, create a list called "Ban List"
	6) Add bans
	
	Note that the ban format for the name of the card is:
	Shedletsky:261

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	
	* Group Admin Help:
	Types of admin
	1 = Mod
	2 = Admin
	3 = Super Admin
	
	The empty table should appear as this:
	['Group Configuration'] = {
		{
			['Group ID'] = 0,
			['Group Rank'] = 0,
			['Tolerance Type'] = '>=',
			['Admin Level'] = 0,
		},
	},
	
	To add a group, create another table inside of the existing one;
	this should look like this:
	['Group Configuration'] = {
		{
			['Group ID'] = 0,
			['Group Rank'] = 0,
			['Tolerance Type'] = '>=',
			['Admin Level'] = 0,
		},
		{
			['Group ID'] = 0,
			['Group Rank'] = 0,
			['Tolerance Type'] = '>=',
			['Admin Level'] = 0,
		},
	},
	
	Now add the group id into it, followed by a comma, followed by the group rank,
	- followed by the level of admin those users should receive.
	
	An example of a finished product is:
	{
		['Group ID'] = 950346,
		['Group Rank'] = 20,
		['Tolerance Type'] = '>=',
		['Admin Level'] = 2,
	},
	
	That will give people in the group id "950346", whom are at rank 20 or higher, level 2 admin,
	- which is regular admin.
	
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	* Command Configuration Help
	
	['Command Configuration'] = {
		['fly'] = {
			['Permission'] = 1,
		},
	},
	
	['fly'] is the command being altered or changed.
	['Permission'] is the property of the command being changed.
	
	There are 5 levels of admin,
	0 = Everyone
	1 = Mod
	2 = Admin
	3 = Superadmin
	4 = Game Creator
	
	If you only wanted admins to fly, change
	the 1 to a 2.
	
	['Command Configuration'] = {
		['fly'] = {
			['Permission'] = 2,
		},
		['unfly'] = {
			['Permission'] = 2,
		},
	},
